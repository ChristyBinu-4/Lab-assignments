1.) Build a linear regression model on the given power plant dataset. Create the
training and testing set. Make predictions of the datapoints in the test set.
Evaluate the model using appropriate performance matrix.

2.) Given the following data, which specify classifications for nine combinations of
VAR1 and VAR2 predict a classification for a case where VAR1=0.906 and
VAR2=0.606, using the result of k- means clustering with 3 means (i.e., 3
centroids)
VAR1 VAR2 CLASS
1.713 1.586 0
0.180 1.786 1
0.353 1.240 1
0.940
1.566 0
1.486 0.759 1
1.266 1.106 0
1.540 0.419 1
0.459 1.799 1
0.773
0.186 1

3.) Find the classification accuracy of K-means algorithm with MNIST dataset.

4.) Build a model to perform classification based on logistic regression on the given
Breast cancer classification dataset. Display confusion matrix and accuracy for
the test data.

5.) Construct a Bayesian classifier using Titanic survival prediction dataset.
Calculate the accuracy, precision, and recall for the data set.
